# Comment System Updates

This document outlines changes made to fix issues with the comment system.

## Problem

There was an issue with adding comments, showing the error:

```
tasks.js:1007 Error adding comment: Error: Failed to add comment
```

The issue was related to timestamp format incompatibility between JavaScript's ISO date format and MySQL's datetime format.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated `comments.php`**:

   - Added date format conversion to handle JavaScript ISO date format
   - Added error handling for date conversion

2. **Modified `database.js`**:

   - Updated the `addComment` method to send properly formatted timestamps
   - Added better error logging

3. **Updated `tasks.js`**:
   - Fixed the `handleAddComment` function to use properly formatted timestamps in WebSocket messages
   - Improved error handling

## Testing

The changes were verified with several test scripts:

- `test_date_format.php` - Tested different date formats with the MySQL database
- `test_comments_fix.php` - Verified the fix with both PHP and JavaScript tests
- Direct testing via the user interface

## Database Structure

The comments are stored in the `task_comments` table with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `task_comments` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `task_id` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `staff_name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `text` text NOT NULL,
  `timestamp` datetime NOT NULL,
  `photo_url` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  `created_at` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT current_timestamp(),
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `idx_task_id` (`task_id`),
  KEY `idx_staff_name` (`staff_name`),
  KEY `idx_timestamp` (`timestamp`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8
```

## Migration Notes

Old comments have been migrated from the JSON format in the `tasks` table to the new `task_comments` table.

To run the migration again if needed, use:

```
php migrate_comments.php
```

The `comments` column from the `tasks` table can be safely removed once all data is migrated.
